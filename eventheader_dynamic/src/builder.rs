/// `EventBuilder` is a builder for events to be written through a [Provider].
///
/// # Overview
///
/// - Check [EventSet::enabled], e.g. `my_eventset_l5k1.enabled()` and only do the
///   remaining steps if it returns true. This avoids the unnecessary work of building
///   and writing the event when no trace collection sessions are listening for your event.
/// - Get an EventBuilder, e.g. `let mut builder = EventBuilder::new();`.
///   - EventBuilder is reusable. In some scenarios, you may get a performance improvement
///     by reusing builders instead of creating a new one for each event.
/// - Call `builder.reset("EventName", event_tag)` to begin building an event.
///   - The event name should be short and distinct. Don't use same name for two events in
///     the same provider that have different fields, levels, or keywords.
///   - event_tag is a 16-bit provider-defined value that will be included in the
///     metadata of the event. Use 0 if you are not using event tags.
/// - For each field you want to add to the event, call one of the `add` methods,
///   `builder.add_KIND("FieldName", field_value, FieldFormat::FORMAT, field_tag)`.
///   - Use [EventBuilder::add_value] to add a field containing a simple value like a
///     bool, char, float, integer, or UUID.
///   - Use [EventBuilder::add_value_sequence] to add a field containing a sequence of
///     simple values like an array of integers.
///   - Use [EventBuilder::add_str] to add a field containing a string or a binary blob.
///   - Use [EventBuilder::add_str_sequence] to add a field containing a sequence of strings or
///     a sequence of binary blobs.
///   - Use [EventBuilder::add_struct] to add a field that contains a group of sub-fields.
///   - The field name should be short and distinct.
///   - The `field_format` controls the how the bytes of the field value will be interpreted
///     by the decoder. For example, if you add a field with a 4-byte value, the
///     `field_format` tells the decoder whether to treat these 4 bytes as a decimal signed
///     integer, a decimal unsigned integer, a hexadecimal unsigned integer, a UCS-4 char, a
///     float, a time, an errno, etc.
///   - field_tag is a 16-bit provider-defined value that will be included in the
///     metadata of the field. Use 0 if you are not using field tags.
/// - If appropriate, configure other event options by calling:
///   - `builder.id_version(id, ver)` to set a manually-assigned event id and version.
///   - `builder.opcode(opcode)` to specify special semantics for the event, e.g.
///      activity-start or activity-stop.
/// - Call `builder.write(event_set, activity_id, related_id)` to
///   send the event to the kernel.
///   - `activity_id` is an optional 128-bit value that can be used during trace
///     analysis to group and correlate events. This should be specified for events that are
///     part of an activity (part of a group of related events), or `None` if the event is
///     not part of an activity.
///   - `related_id` is an optional 128-bit value that indicates the parent of a
///     newly-started activity. This may be specified for
///     [ActivityStart](Opcode::ActivityStart) events and should be `None` for other events.
///
/// # Event Size Limits
///
/// Linux tracepoints have a 64KB size limit. The size includes event headers (timestamp,
/// level, etc.), metadata (event name, field names, field types), and data (field values).
/// Events that are too large will cause `builder.write` to return an error.
