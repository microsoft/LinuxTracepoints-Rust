# perf.data file format

This crate provides support for reading and writing files compatible with the
`perf.data` files generated by the Linux
[perf](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/perf-record.1.html).

Core types:

- `PerfDataFileReader` supports enumerating the headers and events from a `perf.data` file.
  It exposes the data using types from the [tracepoint_decode](../tracepoint_decode) crate,
  making it easy to decode the resulting events and their fields.
- `PerfDataFileWriter` supports writing a `perf.data` file containing caller-supplied headers
  and event data. It includes support for synthesizing some of the more commonly-used headers
  from `tracepoint_decode` metadata types, including the `TRACING_DATA` and `EVENT_DESC`
  headers.
